## Simple version 😌
I made a special version if you only want to use it personally. Works smoother but with less features.  
[**👉 Try it here 👈**](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/tree/personal_only)

## Bugs to fix and features to add 💀  
[**Check the beta branch to find them. They normally also are on the master one**](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot/blob/beta/README.md#bugs-to-fix-and-features-to-add-)  
Those are things that are fixed/added regarding to [`original repo`](https://github.com/EDM115/unzip-bot#license--copyright-%EF%B8%8F)
  
## Config vars 📖
- `APP_ID` - Your APP ID. Get it from [my.telegram.org](my.telegram.org)
- `API_HASH` - Your API_HASH. Get it from [my.telegram.org](my.telegram.org)
- `BOT_OWNER` - Your Telegram Account ID. Get it from [@MissRose_bot](https://t.me/MissRose_bot) (Start the bot and send <samp>/info</samp> command).
- `BOT_TOKEN` - Bot Token of Your Telegram Bot. Get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- `MONGODB_URL` - Your MongoDB URL ([**tutorial here**](./CreateMongoDB.md))
- `LOGS_CHANNEL` - Make a private channel and get its ID (search on Google if you don't know how to do). Using a group works as well, just add [`Rose`](https://t.me/MissRose_bot?startgroup=startbot), then send `/id` (In both cases, make sure to add your bot to the channel/group as an admin !)

## Commands ✍️
Copy-paste those to BotFather when he asks you for them  
```
clean - Remove your archives from my servers 🚮♻️
mode - Upload things as Doc 📄 or Video 📹 (alias : /setmode)
start - Alive check 😪 Also useful after updates 🥰
```  
Admin only commands (better to not include them)  
```

broadcast - Reply with this to a message to send it at every user
ban - {id of user}
unban - {id of user}
```
  
## Deploy 🚧
Deploying is easy 🥰 You can deploy this bot in Heroku or in a VPS ♥️

> ⚠️ Note :
> We are using arch linux. But why 🤔
> 
> Because arch’s p7zip package is the only maintained version of the [original p7zip](http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/) package with some additional features !
